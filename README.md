## 🚨 Problem Statement

**Situation**: In shared residential compounds like Owolawi Compound, multiple occupants (Mr Chi**, Mr Oli**, and Mr Mart**) share electricity costs, creating potential conflicts and disputes.

**Task**: Each occupant needed fair billing based on individual consumption while sharing common utilities like water pump costs.

**Action**: Initially, power usage trackers were installed for each occupant and the water pump to monitor consumption in kWh.

**Result**: However, manual calculations became tedious, error-prone, and lacked transparency, leading to:
- ❌ Disputes over bill accuracy
- ❌ Time-consuming manual calculations
- ❌ Lack of historical consumption tracking
- ❌ No transparency in cost breakdown
- ❌ Difficulty in identifying consumption patterns

---

**Introducing the Electricity Tracker Web App** - A comprehensive digital solution that transforms complex billing calculations into a seamless, transparent process.

### Key Features:
- 🧮 **Automated Calculations**: Instant, accurate bill computation
- 📊 **Transparent Breakdown**: Step-by-step calculation display
- 💧 **Smart Water Cost Splitting**: Automatic division among occupants
- 📈 **Historical Analytics**: Track consumption patterns over time
- 📱 **Mobile-Friendly Interface**: Access from any device
- 🎨 **Customizable Settings**: Adapt to different compounds
- 📊 **Excel Export**: Professional reporting capabilities
- 📧 **Email Notifications**: Automated bill notifications

## 📊 Data & Tools

### **Input Data Sources:**
- **Individual Meter Readings**: Initial and final kWh readings per occupant
- **Water Pump Readings**: Shared utility consumption data
- **Electricity Rate**: Cost per kWh (default: ₦250/kWh)

### **Technology Stack:**
- **Frontend**: Streamlit (Python web framework)
- **Data Processing**: Pandas for calculations and analytics
- **Visualization**: Plotly for interactive charts
- **Data Storage**: JSON files for persistence
- **Export**: Excel integration with OpenPyXL
- **Communication**: SMTP email notifications
- **Deployment**: Streamlit Community Cloud (Free hosting)

### **Calculation Logic:**
```
Individual Cost = (Final Reading - Initial Reading) × Rate per kWh
Water Share = Total Water Cost ÷ Number of Occupants  
Final Bill = Individual Cost + Water Share
```
